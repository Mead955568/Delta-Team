# Deaf Empathy Machine

The term "deaf empathy" describes a person's capacity to comprehend and empathise with the emotions of others. Due to their experiences and forms of communication, deaf people have a distinctive viewpoint on empathy, which is the capacity to feel and comprehend the feelings of others. The use of sign language is one of the fundamental components of deaf empathy. Visual languages like sign language rely on body movement and facial expressions to transmit meaning. As a result, deaf people frequently exhibit increased sensitivity to nonverbal cues and have excellent nonverbal interpretation skills. Because of this, they are better able to detect tiny emotional signs that others might overlook and to react appropriately and sympathetically.

This empathy machine is created to showcase the struggles of deaf people in hospitals. In this application it starts from the house, where the deaf mother finds her daughter is sick and take her to the hospital. Second scene will take place in the hospital and continues there. Through the whole scene player can feel the pain of deaf people. We had an face to face session with the deaf people to understand their difficulties. It made us realize various things about them to create this project.
